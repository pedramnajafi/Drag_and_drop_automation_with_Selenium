# Drag_and_drop_automation_with_Selenium
By this code, you can automate the Drag_and_drop action in Chrome using Selenium (Latest version).

With this code, you can drag one item from the left list and drop it into the right list.

I have used "http://dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/drag-drop-custom/demo-drag-drop-3.html" page for this code. Don't forget to change the "executable_path" which shows the path of "chromedriver.exe" in your system.
